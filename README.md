SUBJECT:  Interactive bookshelf

Team,

Great job so far on the app.  The client has really liked what we have shown them in the demos. Now it's time to make our Bookshelf app interactive so that the librarians can start learning to navigate the new system, test it, and provide us more direct feedback.  To do this, we need to add a couple more features, outlined in the tabs below. Submit the link to your GitHub repo when you're finished and, as always, the help desk is open.

Getting Started
Make sure you still have access to your Bookshelf App repository.
Read through the specs carefully so you know what to build.
Success Metrics (Rubric)
You are free to write the code how you would like, as long as your final product meets the following requirements:

General Code
Design choices are explained and documented in comments.
DOM elements are styled via CSS.

Add Books
Users can enter book title, author, subjects, language and add new Books.
The Bookshelf instance is updated accordingly.
The Bookshelf instance renders Books accurately.

Navigation
A Navigation Bar is included in the web app with links to other parts of the site e.g. "About", "Contact". 
No real information is required. Dummy data or lorum ipsum is fine!

Comments 
Users can leave comments no longer than 280 characters on any Book they want. 
Users can press a "Comment" button which reveals a `text` input element.
Users can then type their comment and click "send" to add it to the Book.
Comments should be represented by HTML elements on the page.
The Book and Bookshelf instances are updated accordingly.
The comments persist even if a search or sort rerenders the Books.
Data can be stored locally or in state memory. A database is not required. 

Optional: Registration
Users should not be able to access the book data unless they have registered a new username and password combination. 
After registering, users should be redirected to the Bookshelf Web App where they can see the book data, add books to the bookshelf, etc.
These credentials do not need to be stored in a database and encrypted for sign in later. This is just an exercise to get us closer to real world web applications.
